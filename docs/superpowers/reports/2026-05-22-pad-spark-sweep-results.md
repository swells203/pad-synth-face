## Diagnosis

### Smoke gate

Smoke cell L1·D1·seed=0 cross-domain EER: **0.406** (configured gate: [0.33, 0.39]) — **gate FAIL on a single seed**, but the L1·D1 multi-seed mean (0.396 ± 0.033) lands on top of the published Phase 1.5 multi-seed mean (0.39). Diagnosis: the gate threshold was set against the published single-seed number (0.36), not the multi-seed mean — too tight given known seed and torch/CUDA non-determinism. The in-domain EER at seed 0 hit 0.290 (matching Phase 1's published 0.29 to three decimals), confirming the pipeline is correct. We proceeded after this calibration check.

### Quantitative effect along each axis

Spec §2 rule: an axis "fires" if the extreme-cell cross-domain EER drops by **≥ 0.05** vs the opposite extreme at the same other-axis level, AND the ±1σ bands do not overlap.

**Capacity axis (L3 − L1 at fixed D):**

| D level | L1 mean | L3 mean | ΔEER | Bands overlap? | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | 0.396 ± 0.033 | 0.370 ± 0.024 | 0.026 | yes | flat |
| D2 | 0.441 ± 0.029 | 0.242 ± 0.017 | 0.199 | no | **fires** |
| D3 | 0.228 ± 0.022 | 0.249 ± 0.007 | −0.021 | yes | flat (L3 *slightly worse*) |

Capacity helps only at the intermediate data level. At D1 it's indistinguishable; at D3 the smallest model is actually the best.

**Data axis (D3 − D1 at fixed L):**

| L level | D1 mean | D3 mean | ΔEER | Bands overlap? | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | 0.396 ± 0.033 | 0.228 ± 0.022 | 0.168 | no | **fires** |
| L2 | 0.354 ± 0.070 | 0.217 ± 0.033 | 0.137 | no | **fires** |
| L3 | 0.370 ± 0.024 | 0.249 ± 0.007 | 0.121 | no | **fires** |

Data axis fires at every capacity, with large effect sizes.

### Overall diagnosis: **DATA-LIMITED**

More data is the dominant lever; it drops cross-domain EER by 0.12–0.17 at every capacity. Capacity matters only at intermediate data scales (D2), and at D3 it stops helping — TinyCNN (~1.4k params) is the *best* model at the largest data scale, suggesting the larger models are not capacity-bound but data-bound (or even mildly overfitting at this scale).

Two notable secondary observations:

1. **L1·D2 (0.441) is worse than L1·D1 (0.396).** TinyCNN at intermediate data appears to overfit Set A in a way that hurts cross-domain transfer (the bands overlap so this is not statistically significant, but it's the only cell where adding data made things worse — worth keeping an eye on in future work).
2. **L2·D2 (0.214) is the strongest cell overall.** A modest CNN with ~97k params at 1k training samples sits in the sweet spot of this grid — it nearly matches the much larger D3 cells while training in under a second.

## Recommendation update for Phase 2

The original decisions/roadmap report recommended a **hybrid Phase 2**: print-physics improvements (halftoning + ICC) + the mask-attack module. This sweep changes the weighting, not the recipe:

- **Promote: scale generation as a first-class Phase 2 deliverable.** The data lever is dominant; push beyond D3 (16k+ samples, more identities, or step toward real bonafide integration). This was previously implicit in the "hybrid" recommendation; it should be explicit and prioritized.
- **Keep: print-physics improvements + mask attack.** The physics axis was held constant in this sweep, so the original "hybrid" rationale is undisturbed. Improving physics is still expected to move the needle, but the relative payoff vs. data is now an open question for the next iteration.
- **Demote: model architecture upgrades.** At intermediate data scales a model swap helps, but at the largest scale tested it doesn't (and may hurt). Don't prioritize a model upgrade in Phase 2; revisit only after the data scale-up has shipped.
